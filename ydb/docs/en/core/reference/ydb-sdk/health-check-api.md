# Health Check API

{{ ydb-short-name }} has a built-in self-diagnostic system, which can be used to get a brief report on the database status and information about existing issues.

To initiate the check, call the `SelfCheck` method from `NYdb::NMonitoring` namespace in the SDK. You must also pass the name of the checked DB as usual.

{% list tabs %}

- C++

  App code snippet for creating a client:
  ```cpp
  auto client = NYdb::NMonitoring::TMonitoringClient(driver);
  ```

  Calling `SelfCheck` method:

  ```
  auto settings = TSelfCheckSettings();
  settings.ReturnVerboseStatus(true);
  auto result = client.SelfCheck(settings).GetValueSync();
  ```

{% endlist %}

## Call parameters {#call-parameters}

`SelfCheck` method provides information in the form of a [set of issues](#emergency-example) which could look like this:

```json
{
  "id": "RED-27c3-70fb",
  "status": "RED",
  "message": "Database has multiple issues",
  "location": {
    "database": {
      "name": "/slice"
    }
  },
  "reason": [
    "RED-27c3-4e47",
    "RED-27c3-53b5",
    "YELLOW-27c3-5321"
  ],
  "type": "DATABASE",
  "level": 1
}
```

This is a short messages each about a single problem. All parameters will affect the amount of information the service returns for the specified database.

The whole list of extra parameters presented below:

{% list tabs %}

- C++

  ```c++
  struct TSelfCheckSettings : public TOperationRequestSettings<TSelfCheckSettings>{
      FLUENT_SETTING_OPTIONAL(bool, ReturnVerboseStatus);
      FLUENT_SETTING_OPTIONAL(EStatusFlag, MinimumStatus);
      FLUENT_SETTING_OPTIONAL(ui32, MaximumLevel);
  };
  ```

{% endlist %}

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|:----|:----|:----|
| `ReturnVerboseStatus` | `bool`         | If `ReturnVerboseStatus` is specified, the response will also include a summary of the overall health of the database in the `database_status` field ([Example](#example-verbose)). Default is false. |
| `MinimumStatus`       | [EStatusFlag] (#issue-status) | Each issue has a `status` field. If `minimum_status` is specified, issues with a higher `status` will be discarded. By default, all issues will be listed. |
| `MaximumLevel`        | `int32`        | Each issue has a `level` field. If `maximum_level` is specified, issues with deeper levels will be discarded. By default, all issues will be listed. |

## Response structure {#response-structure}

For the full response structure, see the [ydb_monitoring.proto](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/public/api/protos/ydb_monitoring.proto) file in the {{ ydb-short-name }} Git repository.
Calling the `SelfCheck` method will return the following message:

```protobuf
message SelfCheckResult {
    SelfCheck.Result self_check_result = 1;
    repeated IssueLog issue_log = 2;
    repeated DatabaseStatus database_status = 3;
    LocationNode location = 4;
}
```

The shortest HealthCheck response looks like [this](#examples) . It is returned if there is nothing wrong with the database.

If any issues are detected, the `issue_log` field will contain descriptions of the issues with the following structure:

```protobuf
message IssueLog {
    string id = 1;
    StatusFlag.Status status = 2;
    string message = 3;
    Location location = 4;
    repeated string reason = 5;
    string type = 6;
    uint32 level = 7;
}
```

These issues can be arranged hierarchically with `id` and `reason` fields, which help to visualize how issues in a separate module affect the state of the system as a whole. All issues are arranged in a hierarchy where higher levels can depend on nested levels:

![cards_hierarchy](./_assets/hc_cards_hierarchy.png)

Each issue has a nesting `level` - the higher the `level`, the deeper the ish is in the hierarchy. Issues with the same `type` always have the same `level` and they can be represented as a hierarchy.

![issues_hierarchy](./_assets/hc_types_hierarchy.png)

Description of all fields in the response is provided below:

| Field | Description |
|:----|:----|
| `self_check_result` | enum field which contains the [DB check result](#selfcheck-result) |
| `issue_log.id` | A unique issue ID within this response. |
| `issue_log.status` |  enum field which contains the [issue status](#issue-status) |
| `issue_log.message` | Text that describes the issue. |
| `issue_log.location` | Location of the issue. This can be a physical location or an execution context. |
| `issue_log.reason` | This is a set of elements, each of which describes a issue in the system at a certain level. |
| `issue_log.type` | Issue category (by subsystem). Each type is at a certain level and interconnected with others through a rigid hierarchy (as shown in the picture above). |
| `issue_log.level` | The depth of issue nesting. |
| `database_status` | If settings contains `ReturnVerboseStatus` parameter than `database_status` field will be filled. <br/>It provides a summary of the overall health of the database. <br/>It's used to quickly review the overall health of the database, helping to assess its health and whether there are any serious issues at a high level. [Example](#example-verbose). |
| `location` | Contains information about host, where `HealthCheck` service was called |

### DB check result {#selfcheck-result}

The most general statuses of the database, which can have the following values:

| Value | Description |
|:----|:----|
| `GOOD` | No issues were detected. |
| `DEGRADED` | Degradation of one of the database systems was detected, but the database is still functioning (for example, allowable disk loss). |
| `MAINTENANCE_REQUIRED` | Significant degradation was detected, there is a risk of availability loss, and human maintenance is required. |
| `EMERGENCY` | A serious issue was detected in the database, with complete or partial loss of availability. |

### Issue status {#issue-status}

Status (severity) of the current issue:

| Value | Description |
|:----|:----|
| `GREY` | Failed to determine the status (a issue with the self-diagnostic mechanism). |
| `GREEN` | No issues were detected. |
| `BLUE` | Temporary minor degradation that does not affect database availability. The system is expected to switch to `GREEN`. |
| `YELLOW` | A minor issue, no risks to availability. We recommend you continue monitoring the issue. |
| `ORANGE` | A serious issue, we are one step away from losing availability. Maintenance may be required. |
| `RED` | A component is faulty or unavailable. |
