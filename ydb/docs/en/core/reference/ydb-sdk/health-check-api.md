description: "The article will tell you how to initiate the check using the Health Check API built-in self-diagnostic system in {{ ydb-short-name }}."

# Health Check API

{{ ydb-short-name }} has a built-in self-diagnostic system, which can be used to get a brief report on the database status and information about existing problems.

To initiate the check, call the `SelfCheck` method from SDK `Ydb.Monitoring`. You must also pass the name of the checked DB as usual.

{% list tabs %}

- C++
  App code snippet for creating a client:
  ```cpp
  auto client = NYdb::NMonitoring::TMonitoringClient(driver);
  ```
  Calling `SelfCheck` method:
  ```

  auto settings = TSelfCheckSettings();
  settings.ReturnVerboseStatus(true);
  auto result = client.SelfCheck(settings).GetValueSync();
  ```

{% endlist %}

## Response Structure {#response-structure}
For the full response structure, see the [ydb_monitoring.proto](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/public/api/protos/ydb_monitoring.proto) file in the {{ ydb-short-name }} Git repository.
Calling the `SelfCheck` method will return the following message:

```protobuf
message SelfCheckResult {
    SelfCheck.Result self_check_result = 1;
    repeated IssueLog issue_log = 2;
}
```

If any issues are detected, the `issue_log` field will contain descriptions of the problems with the following structure:
```protobuf
message IssueLog {
    string id = 1;
    StatusFlag.Status status = 2;
    string message = 3;
    Location location = 4;
    repeated string reason = 5;
    string type = 6;
    uint32 level = 7;
}
```
These issues can be arranged hierarchically with `id` and `reason` fields, which help to visualize how problems in a separate module affect the state of the system as a whole. All issues are arranged in a hierarchy where higher levels can depend on nested levels:

![cards_hierarchy](./_assets/hc_cards_hierarchy.png)

Each issue has a nesting `level` - the higher the `level`, the deeper the ish is in the hierarchy. Issues with the same `type` always have the same `level` and they can be represented as a hierarchy.

| Field | Description |
|:----|:----|
| `self_check_result` | enum field which contains the DB check result:<ul><li>`GOOD`: No problems were detected.</li><li>`DEGRADED`: Degradation of one of the database systems was detected, but the database is still functioning (for example, allowable disk loss).</li><li>`MAINTENANCE_REQUIRED`: Significant degradation was detected, there is a risk of availability loss, and human maintenance is required.</li><li>`EMERGENCY`: A serious problem was detected in the database, with complete or partial loss of availability.</li></ul> |
| `issue_log` | This is a set of elements, each of which describes a problem in the system at a certain level. |
| `issue_log.id` | A unique problem ID within this response. |
| `issue_log.id` | A unique problem ID within this response. |
| `issue_log.id` | A unique problem ID within this response. |
| `issue_log.status` | Status (severity) of the current problem. <br/>It can take one of the following values:</li><li>`RED`: A component is faulty or unavailable.</li><li>`ORANGE`: A serious problem, we are one step away from losing availability. Maintenance may be required.</li><li>`YELLOW`: A minor problem, no risks to availability. We recommend you continue monitoring the problem.</li><li>`BLUE`: Temporary minor degradation that does not affect database availability. The system is expected to switch to `GREEN`.</li><li>`GREEN`: No problems were detected.</li><li>`GREY`: Failed to determine the status (a problem with the self-diagnostic mechanism).</li></ul> |
| `issue_log.message` | Text that describes the problem. |
| `issue_log.location` | Location of the problem. This can be a physical location or an execution context. |
| `issue_log.reason` | This is a set of elements, each of which describes a problem in the system at a certain level. |
| `issue_log.type` | Problem category (by subsystem). Each type is at a certain level and interconnected with others through a rigid hierarchy (as shown in the picture above). |
| `issue_log.level` | The depth of problem nesting. |
| `database_status` | If settings contains `verbose` parameter than `database_status` field will be filled. <br/>It provides a summary of the overall health of the database. <br/>It's used to quickly review the overall health of the database, helping to assess its health and whether there are any serious problems at a high level. [Example](#example-verbose). |
| `location` | Contains information about host, where `HealthCheck` service was called |


## Call parameters {#call-parameters}
The whole list of extra parameters presented below:

{% list tabs %}

- C++
  ```c++
  struct TSelfCheckSettings : public TOperationRequestSettings<TSelfCheckSettings>{
      FLUENT_SETTING_OPTIONAL(bool, ReturnVerboseStatus);
      FLUENT_SETTING_OPTIONAL(EStatusFlag, MinimumStatus);
      FLUENT_SETTING_OPTIONAL(ui32, MaximumLevel);
  };
  ```

{% endlist %}

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|:----|:----|
| `ReturnVerboseStatus` | `bool`         | As mentioned earlier, this parameter affects the filling of the `database_status` field. Default is false. |
| `MinimumStatus`       | `EStatusFlag`  | The minimum severity status that will appear in the response. Less severe issues will be discarded. By default, all issues will be listed. |
| `MaximumLevel`        | `int32`        | The maximum depth of issues in the response. Issues at deeper levels will be discarded. By default, all issues will be listed. |

## Possible problems {#problems}

| Message | Description |
|:----|:----|
| **DATABASE** ||
| `Database has multiple issues`</br>`Database has compute issues`</br>`Database has storage issues` | These issues depend solely on the underlying `COMPUTE` and `STORAGE` layers. This is the most general status of a database. |
| **STORAGE** ||
| `There are no storage pools` | Storage pools aren't configured. |
| `Storage degraded`</br>`Storage has no redundancy`</br>`Storage failed` | These issues depend solely on the underlying `STORAGE_POOLS` layer. |
| `System tablet BSC didn't provide information` | Storage diagnostics will be generated alternatively. |
| `Storage usage over 75%` <br>`Storage usage over 85%` <br>`Storage usage over 90%` | Some data needs to be removed, or the database needs to be reconfigured with additional disk space. |
| **STORAGE_POOL** ||
| `Pool degraded` <br>`Pool has no redundancy` <br>`Pool failed` | These issues depend solely on the underlying `STORAGE_GROUP` layer. |
| **STORAGE_GROUP** ||
| `Group has no vslots` | This case is not expected, it inner problem. |
| `Group degraded` | A number of disks allowed in the group are not available. |
| `Group has no redundancy` | A storage group lost its redundancy. –ênother failure of vdisk may lead to the loss of the group. |
| `Group failed` | A storage group lost its integrity. Data is not available |
||`HealthCheck` checks various parameters (fault tolerance mode, number of failed disks, disk status, etc.) and, depending on them, sets the appropriate status and displays a message. |
| **VDISK** ||
| `System tablet BSC didn't provide known status` | This case is not expected, it inner problem. |
| `VDisk is not available` | the disk is not operational at all. |
| `VDisk is being initialized` | initialization in process. |
| `Replication in progress` | the disk accepts queries, but not all the data was replicated. |
| `VDisk have space issue` | These issues depend solely on the underlying `PDISK` layer. |
| **PDISK** ||
| `Unknown PDisk state` | `HealthCheck` the system can't parse pdisk state. |
| `PDisk state is ...` | Indicates state of physical disk. |

```json
{
  "self_check_result": "GOOD"
}
```
